At its core, **Blackout NZ** asks players:
*What kind of mark will you make?*

*Will you stand alone... or create with others?*
*And when someone tries to clean up the mess...*
*...will you let them?*

once you finish the game all your drops come back and you can create your own crew and be the founder or you can join another crew and you get the legend rank for saving new zealnd but in future updates mastamind is going to flee to austraila and start the blaqwt there then he could take over the world....
all hand drawn art for ui and other game elements,
style and design im looking for jetset radio future,getting up under construction,custom crew emblems,custom crew themes,custom crews only available after full game completion
"ending mastamind main villian flees to australia and starts a new blackout nz stays safe and we get to keep our art and music but lzt,bqc,sps,dgc form over in AUS to help and plan to defend NZ/AUS/MUSIC/ART"
mastaminds plan is so successful he actually knew all long everybody was going to play and players all around the world get there art/music stolen and sold to another universe hes also steals gregorys portal prototype and starts blackout all over the galaxy universe and heavens hells and everywhere.....
The answer is in every drop placed, every collaboration formed, every piece of history preserved, and every new artist welcomed into the crew.

i want it to work on android a iphone with a screen orientation locked only in portrait mode....also i changed from soundcloud to spotify
also all music will be new zealand music from real new zealnd artists

 
**Welcome to the resistance.**
**Welcome to the collaboration.**
**Welcome to Blackout NZ.**
